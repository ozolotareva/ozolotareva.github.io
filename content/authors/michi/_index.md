I am a PhD student at the Chair of Computational Systems Biology at the University of Hamburg. My research interests revolve around regulatory interaction networks. I received a Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at the Goethe University in 2018 in Frankfurt, followed by a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the TUM and LMU in Munich in 2021. I finished my Master's thesis creating CADDIE, a web application for drug-repurposing in cancer. In 2019/20, I spent one year at the University of Helsinki. During my studies, I was working in different tech startups doing software development and software engineering.
