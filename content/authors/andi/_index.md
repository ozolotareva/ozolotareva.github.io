In May 2021, I start as a PhD student at Cosy.Bio at the UHH. My current tasks include work surrounding the REPO-TRIAL drug repurposing project. In August 2020, I joined the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TUM for the thesis of my Bioinformatics master's degree.There, I focused on the development of a web application for the analysis and exploration of heterogeneous molecular disease networks.
