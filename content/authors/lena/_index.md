I’m a PhD candidate at Cosy.Bio since April 2021. I studied Computer Science at TUM and gained some experience with ligand binding site prediction in a project at Rostlab and as a research assistant on Human T-cell Immunology at Zielinski Lab. I joined the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TUM to work on exon-speciﬁc differences in microRNA regulation due to alternative splicing for my Master’s thesis. Currently I'm interested in the study of alternative splicing in transcription factors.
