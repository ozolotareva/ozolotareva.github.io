      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aggregating transcriptomics data across hospitals can increase sensitivity and robustness of differential expression analyses, yielding deeper clinical insights. As data exchange is often restricted by privacy legislation, meta-analyses are frequently employed to pool local results. However, if class labels are inhomogeneously distributed between cohorts, their accuracy may drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flimma (&lt;a href=&#34;https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/flimma/&#34;&gt;https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/flimma/&lt;/a&gt;) addresses this issue by implementing the state-of-the-art workflow limma voom in a privacy-preserving manner, i.e. patient data never leaves its source site. Flimma results are identical to those generated by limma voom on combined datasets even in imbalanced scenarios where meta-analysis approaches fail.&lt;/p&gt;
